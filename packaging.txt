Need to make sure the config.xml gets updated correctly.


Add a new Git tag.

PUSH the new tag to the site:

$ git push --tags origin master


Make a release:
https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release

{
  "tag_name": "v1.0.0",
  "target_commitish": "master",
  "name": "v1.0.0",
  "body": "Description of what was updated."
  "draft": false,
  "prerelease": false
}

Can also link to:
  https://github.com/EsriOceans/btm/releases/latest

to get the 'latest release', but it's probably better to push it to AGOL.


SEE the implementation in r-arcgis-install for how to check releases from GitHub.
